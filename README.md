# AGED

Aged is an application designed to help you remember and track your special moments, such as anniversaries. By entering the date of your first special moment, you can easily keep track of the days that have passed since that day. With Aged, you'll never forget how long it has been since your special moment, and you can access this information whenever you need it.
